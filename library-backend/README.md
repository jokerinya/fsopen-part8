# Exercises

## Exercises 8.1.-8.7.

Through the exercises, we will implement a GraphQL backend for a small library. Start with [this file](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/misc/blob/master/library-backend.js). Remember to `npm init` and to install dependencies!

Note that the code does not initially work since the schema definition is not complete.

## 8.1: The number of books and authors

Implement queries bookCount and authorCount which return the number of books and the number of authors.

The query

```graphql
query {
    bookCount
    authorCount
}
```

should return

```json
{
    "data": {
        "bookCount": 7,
        "authorCount": 5
    }
}
```

## 8.1: The number of books and authors

Implement queries bookCount and authorCount which return the number of books and the number of authors.

The query

```graphql
query {
    bookCount
    authorCount
}
```

should return

```json
{
    "data": {
        "bookCount": 7,
        "authorCount": 5
    }
}
```

## 8.2: All books

Implement query `allBooks`, which returns the details of all books.

In the end, the user should be able to do the following query:

```graphql
query {
    allBooks {
        title
        author
        published
        genres
    }
}
```

## 8.3: All authors

Implement query `allAuthors`, which returns the details of all authors. The response should include a field `bookCount` containing the number of books the author has written.

For example the query

```graphql
query {
    allAuthors {
        name
        bookCount
    }
}
```

should return

```json
{
    "data": {
        "allAuthors": [
            {
                "name": "Robert Martin",
                "bookCount": 2
            },
            {
                "name": "Martin Fowler",
                "bookCount": 1
            },
            {
                "name": "Fyodor Dostoevsky",
                "bookCount": 2
            },
            {
                "name": "Joshua Kerievsky",
                "bookCount": 1
            },
            {
                "name": "Sandi Metz",
                "bookCount": 1
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## 8.4: Books of an author

Modify the `allBooks` query so that a user can give an optional parameter author. The response should include only books written by that author.

For example query

```graphql
query {
    allBooks(author: "Robert Martin") {
        title
    }
}
```

should return

```json
{
    "data": {
        "allBooks": [
            {
                "title": "Clean Code"
            },
            {
                "title": "Agile software development"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## 8.5: Books by genre

Modify the query `allBooks` so that a user can give an optional parameter `genre`. The response should include only books of that genre.

For example query

```graphql
query {
    allBooks(genre: "refactoring") {
        title
        author
    }
}
```

should return

```json
{
    "data": {
        "allBooks": [
            {
                "title": "Clean Code",
                "author": "Robert Martin"
            },
            {
                "title": "Refactoring, edition 2",
                "author": "Martin Fowler"
            },
            {
                "title": "Refactoring to patterns",
                "author": "Joshua Kerievsky"
            },
            {
                "title": "Practical Object-Oriented Design, An Agile Primer Using Ruby",
                "author": "Sandi Metz"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The query must work when both optional parameters are given:

```graphql
query {
    allBooks(author: "Robert Martin", genre: "refactoring") {
        title
        author
    }
}
```

## 8.6: Adding a book

Implement mutation addBook, which can be used like this:

```graphql
mutation {
    addBook(
        title: "NoSQL Distilled"
        author: "Martin Fowler"
        published: 2012
        genres: ["database", "nosql"]
    ) {
        title
        author
    }
}
```

The mutation works even if the author is not already saved to the server:

```graphql
mutation {
    addBook(
        title: "Pimeyden tango"
        author: "Reijo M채ki"
        published: 1997
        genres: ["crime"]
    ) {
        title
        author
    }
}
```

If the author is not yet saved to the server, a new author is added to the system. The birth years of authors are not saved to the server yet, so the query

```graphql
query {
    allAuthors {
        name
        born
        bookCount
    }
}
```

returns

```json
{
    "data": {
        "allAuthors": [
            // ...
            {
                "name": "Reijo M채ki",
                "born": null,
                "bookCount": 1
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## 8.7: Updating the birth year of an author

Implement mutation `editAuthor`, which can be used to set a birth year for an author. The mutation is used like so:

```graphql
mutation {
    editAuthor(name: "Reijo M채ki", setBornTo: 1958) {
        name
        born
    }
}
```

If the correct author is found, the operation returns the edited author:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "editAuthor": {
            "name": "Reijo M채ki",
            "born": 1958
        }
    }
}
```

If the author is not in the system, null is returned:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "editAuthor": null
    }
}
```
